----------

How to play the game:

Chose a map, and guess countries.
When you are finshed the programm will generate a file that you can find in the ./output folder, where is lists every country that you have failed to guess.

----------
How to use the data creator in datacreator.py
If you want to add additional countries/states or create a new data set (=Map) from scratch, set the map_name to name of the map you want to create/edit.
Hint: it has to have a background image already saved with this exact name, previously saved data is optional.

e.g.:
to create a map called „africa“ you have to have already safed a background image in the ./maps folder. This image hast o be a .gif file. If you just want to visualise every country se tappend to False, to edit the data set, keep append as True.
